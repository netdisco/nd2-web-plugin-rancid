NAME
    App::NetdiscoX::Web::Plugin::RANCID - Link to device backups in
    RANCID/WebSVN

SYNOPSIS
     # in your ~/environments/deployment.yml file

     extra_web_plugins:
       - X::RANCID

     plugin_rancid:
       location: 'https://websvn.example.com/websvn/filedetails.php?repname=rancid&path=/%GROUP%/configs/%DEVICE%'

Description
    This is a plugin for the App::Netdisco network management application.
    It adds a row to the Device Details page named "RANCID" with a link to
    your local RANCID/WebSVN installation hosting the device configuration
    backups.

Configuration
    Create an entry in your "~/environments/deployment.yml" file named
    ""plugin_rancid"", containing the following settings:

  location
    Value: String, Required.

    Name of the server hosting your local WebSVN installation. This should
    also include the path under which backup files are stored for the
    devices.

    The text ""%DEVICE%"" must be included, and it will be substituted with
    the name or IP of the device. That is, this setting must be a complete
    link to a RANCID web page, only with the device name or ip changed to be
    ""%DEVICE%"".

    The text ""%GROUP%"" will be replaced with the group name for this
    device, if known to Netdisco. This uses the same configuration as for
    App::Netdisco::Worker::Plugin::MakeRancidConf, an example of which is
    below:

     rancid:
       by_ip:           [ other ]
       by_hostname:     'group:grp-reversedns'
       groups:
         aerohive:      'group:grp-hiveos'
         switch:        [ 'name:.*[Ss][Ww].*' ]
         rtr:           [ 'name:[rR]tr.*' ]
         ap:            [ 'name:[aA][pP].*' ]

    Briefly, each group value is a list of rules for matching devices
    similar to those used by any *_only configuration item. You can provide
    an IP, subnet or prefix, regular expression to match a device name, or
    device attribute and regular expression as in the above example.

    The device DNS name is used, or if missing the device SNMP sysName.
    Adding the group to the list in "by_ip" will make the link include the
    device IP instead of the name. Adding the group to the list in
    "by_hostname" will use the device FQDN minus the "domain_suffix" config
    item (i.e. the hostname). "by_hostname" will take precedence over
    "by_ip".

  open_in_same_window
    Value: Boolean. Default: false.

    If set to true, the hyperlink is configured to open the WebSVN page in
    the same browser window or tab as Netdisco.
